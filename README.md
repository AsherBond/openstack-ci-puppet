These are a set of puppet manifests and modules that are currently being
used to manage some of the efforts of the OpenStack CI project. They are
quite bare and crappy at the moment, but should grow soon.

Additionally, there is a script, make_puppet_lp.py which is used to generate
a few lists of users from launchpad teams, to make management and population
of user accounts on different types of servers easier.
